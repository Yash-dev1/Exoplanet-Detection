# Exoplanet-Detection

The focus of this project is to classify the data consisting of stars and their flux density effortlessly on a large scale to predict the existence of exoplanets in their vicinity without any human intervention. The usage of artificial intelligence techniques are aimed at elucidating the problem of increased computational time and complexity associated with existing deep learning techniques. Various machine learning algorithms and classifiers have been explored and applied on the dataset in terms of runtime, accuracy and quality of label output and a comparative analysis has been done on the performance of each model in consideration.
